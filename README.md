🚀 Excited to share the insights from my recent data analysis project using Excel, Python, and Power BI! 📊

Here's a snapshot of a dataset I'm currently working with, shedding light on various aspects of applicants' profiles. It's fascinating to see how diverse and dynamic individuals' backgrounds can be. Take a look at the key fields:

👤 Applicant Demographics: Gender, Age, Family Status

Analyzing this data opens doors to understanding societal trends and individual financial behaviors. Here are some key findings:

⚡ Financial Overview: The average income of applicants stands at $195k, with an average total debt of $22k.
